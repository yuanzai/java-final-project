# java-final-project
This is a simple side scroller shooter built in java

Code was based of https://bitbucket.org/csgerber/profinal/src
However, most of it is has been changed short of the game engine implementation which was a simple thread looping graphics updates in the main UI

My implementations include:
- side scrolling mechanic
- gravity/jumping mechanic
- seeking projectile
- laser projectile collision with other sprites or floors
